@1  = ~Who are you? It matters not, I have come to conquer this miserable town. Just a short stop on my road to world conquest. Bow down before your new master and I may spare your wretched lives.~
@2  = ~Um. Do you have any idea who we are? Or are you just another stupid megalomaniac? I'm guessing the latter.~
@3  = ~Uh. Hi there.~
@4  = ~God, not another one. Is there something in the water or do I just attract lunatics?~
@5  = ~What? The worm wishes to address me? Go ahead pathetic one.~
@6  = ~Damn, why, why, why, me? Are you going to leave peacefully, or do I have to break your skull?~
@7  = ~Uh. What can we help you with?~
@8  = ~You. Dare. To. Insult. Me?! Ha! I shall not sully my blade with the blood on one as wretched as you. Fall to my minions!~
@9  = ~Oh get lost.~
@10  = ~They all said I was insane, but I'll show them.... I will prove that my theory that our universe is nothing more then a grain of sand on an infinite beach! Oops. Wrong game. Um. Yeah, well, I'll just be leaving now.~
@11 = ~I think I'm going to cry.~
@12 = ~You wish my life story? Very well. Well, for starters I was born in..~
@13 = ~Actually, I didn't ask for your life story, I just asked what the hell your doing here. Just so I know whether or not to kill you.~
@14 = ~Um. I hate to interrupt, but can we cut this short and get to the violent part?~
@15 = ~Oh. But don't you want to hear the tragic story of my past?~
@16 = ~No, not really. I'm just going to kill you after all, what do I care about your tragic past?~
@17 = ~*sigh* I suppose so. It's not like I have anything better to do, like saving an elven city from a psychotic madman for example.~
@18 = ~Very well puny one. Pray to your gods before I crush you.~
@19 = ~Right. Lets get violent!~
@20 = ~Very well, it all began during the Time of Troubles when the gods walked the earth. As you may or may not know, the dead god Bhaal sired a number of children with mortals to aid in his resurrection. I am one of those children, my mother was a powerful mage in the service of one of Bhaals temples. When the time came for me to be sacrificed, my mother couldn't bear it, and spirited me away.~
@21 = ~And I care..... why?~
@22 = ~Oh man, another of my siblings with moronic dreams of conquest, lets just go ahead and beat each other to a bloody pulp, it's what's going to happen anyway.~
@23 = ~Silence mortal! Allow your betters to speak. Ahem. Now, as I was SAYing my mother spirited me away, but was badly injured in the attempt. She died not long after, leaving me, a small child, alone in this cruel cruel world.~
@24 = ~Ok, I've had enough of this sob story. Time to die.~
@25 = ~Please, go on, it sounds like you had a horrible childhood.~
@26 = ~You dare to patronize me?!? Do you have any idea who you are messing with? Die impudent one!~
@27 = ~Whoops, should have seen that one coming.~
@28 = ~You have slain my son, now I shall deal with you personally, prepare to suffer an eternity of torment! Did that sound overly dramatic? I can't quite get my delivery down.~
@29 = ~A little, the whole eternity thing was a bit overkill, but hey, who cares, we're going to butcher each other anyway.~
@30 = ~Not at all, we did just chop your son into tiny weenie bits. And your next.~
@31 = ~Please, you must protect our poor village my <LADYLORD>! A evil mage has been taking over small villages to the north of here. He turns the populous into slaves for his ever-growing army! I shall stay here and organize our defenses. The others have already gathered inside the inn.~
@32 = ~Of course good mayor, how could I do anything less? (Who writes this crappy dialog?)~
@33 = ~I don't think so, you guys are on your own.~
@34 = ~Once again you come to us in our hour of need, my <LADYLORD>. Please remember, if either my wife or I are slain, our meager defenses will crumble and all will be lost. Protect us at all costs. Ha. For once the dumb civilians can't be butchered.~
@35 = ~Of course mayor. Fear not.~
@36 = ~Please my <LADYLORD>, without you we wont stand a chance!~
@37 = ~Very well, but I expect to be rewarded very well.~
@38 = ~Pfagh. THEN I guess you don't stand a chance do you?~
@39 = ~Very well. Then we accept our fates, and may the gods strike you down for what you have done. Prick.~
@40 = ~Ha. I make my own fates, the gods desires notwithstanding.~
@41 = ~Jugend draws power from one of his subordinates. He is fully healed!~
@42 = ~Jugend tries to draw power from one of his subordinates, but you have slain both!~
@43 = ~Awww, fuck. There goes the mayor.~
@44 = ~Cry? Hold on, I think I have a handkerchief here somewhere...~
@45 = ~He rummages through a very large backpack....~
@46 = ~Wait! You're trying to trick me! I don't own a handkerchief! Now my minions shall destroy you.~
@47 = ~Can't I ever fight a SANE bad guy? I mean, is that too much to ask?~
@48 = ~Wait, don't tell me you're another bunch of goody two shoes, always interfering with the grand plans of a poor Bhaalspawn like myself. Don't you people have ANYTHING better to do? Like helping old ladies across the street or something? Well, regardless, I'm taking over this town! And for once evil has a decent chance to win!~
@49 = ~Now my <LADYLORD> let me tell you what I have learned about our attackers......~
@50 = ~They are led by a powerful mage called Jugend. He has two lieutenants, a mage named Ayrus and a mage called Maia. They each lead a section of his army. His son leads the third section. Beware his son, he is a powerful fighter and not to be trifled with.~
@51 = ~Supposedly his army is almost without end, but in order for him to continue bringing in reinforcements, his two lieutenants and his son have to hold open portals.~
@52 = ~By killing his son you will close the lower two portals, and by killing his lieutenants you will close the three upper portals.~
@53 = ~Do you wish me to tell you all sorts of things about Jugend's army that I have absolutely no business knowing?~
@54 = ~Sure. I always love it when characters explain EXACTLY what I am supposed to do.~
@55 = ~Nah. I actually like to figure some things out for myself. Mind you, after I die five or six times I'll choose the other option.~
@56 = ~Also, those who you have aided in the past will come to aid you. Use them well. We have only a few minutes before they attack. And don't forget, DON'T LET ME DIE. Good luck. This peon will self-destruct in 5 seconds.~
@57 = ~Uh. Yeah. Ok then.~
@58 = ~Good luck then my <LADYLORD>, we only have a few minutes before they attack.~
@59 = ~Ahhh!!~
@60 = ~We have come to fulfill our part of the bargain. We will help protect the village. Tell us what to do.~
@61 = ~Great. Thank you for your help Madulf.~
@62 = ~Greetings protector of the forest. The spirits of the forest have come to aid you against the evil that threatens the land.~
@63 = ~All help is appreciated. The coming fight will be extremely tough.~
@64 = ~A spell trigger is fired!~
@65 = ~A contingency is triggered!~
@66 = ~No! You WILL die!~
@67 = ~RABBITS?! That's the last time I EVER buy a near death contingency from the discount shop!~
